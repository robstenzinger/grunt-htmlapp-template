My core boilerplate for web projects.

Last update: February 11, 2014

## Features

- sets up a basic web project and folders
- can be built and served via grunt
- adds live reload for convenient dev workflow
- has some yeoman wiring in the grunt file also, for optional distribution features
- can use scss
- use bower install to add remaining ingredients
    + knockout or ember if data binding is needed
    + handlebars if client side templates are needed
    + add a CSS framework: either Semantic UI or Bootstrap

## Notes

- combine with Ghostlab for convenient multi client testing
- search and replace "HTML5App" to rename the core app in code

## Instructions

- make a project folder out of this folder
- run bower install add-ons such as Semantic UI (semantic) or Bootstrap-Sass (bootstrap-sass) 
- run npm install to get grunt up and running
- run grunt serve to see the build process work or address any issues to complete setup
